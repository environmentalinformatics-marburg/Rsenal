\title{bump package 'Version:' and 'Date:' in DESCRIPTION file}
\usage{
bumpVersion(element = "patch", pkg.repo = "."
, news = file.path(pkg.repo, "NEWS.md"), plain_news = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{element}{character - one of "major", "minor", "patch" to be bumped.
Defaults to "patch"}

\item{pkg.repo}{path to package repository folder. Default is current
working directory (".")}

\item{news}{the NEWS.md file of the repo (assumed to be in top level path). 
If this exists, the first line of that file will be rewritten 
to be "<packagename> <major.minor.patch>". Note that the current implementation 
assumes that the NEWS file is in .md format, thus NEWS.md. A plain NEWS
file (for R-help pages) will be generated automatically.}

\item{plain_news}{whether to generate a plain NEWS file in the package
root directory from the NEWS.md file supplied to argument \code{news}.}
}
\description{

your package's DESCRIPTION file. Additionally, it bumps the version 
numbers of a NEWS.md file and automatically generates a corresponding 
plain NEWS file (for R-help pages).
